    <h3 class="description">If you're in the mood for a fun summer drink,
             this mint mojito recipe is just what you need!
              It's refreshing, delicious, and super easy to make.
        </h3>
        <p>The refreshing and quaffable nature of the Mojito has rendered 
            it a warm-weather favorite among drinkers. 
            As fussy as it may be to make, a balanced Mojito is nearly 
            impossible to hate—unless you’re a bartender making hundreds
             of the messy and time-consuming drink during a busy shift. 
             The cocktail’s origin can be traced back to pre-Prohibition Cuba,
              where potent cane spirits (aka aguardientes) were tamed by
               the addition of lime juice, sugar and mint. 
               The ice and soda water came into the mix around Prohibition and
                the years shortly after, at which point the drink 
                took on the form we know today.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>juice of 1 lime</li>
            <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>small handful mint leaves, plus extra sprig to serve</li>
            <li>60ml white rum</li>
            <li>soda water, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Muddle the lime juice, sugar and mint leaves in a small jug,
                 crushing the mint as you go – you can use the end of a rolling
                  pin for this. Pour into a tall glass and add a handful of ice.
            </li>
            <li>Pour over the rum, stirring with a long-handled spoon.
                 Top up with soda water, garnish with mint and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
