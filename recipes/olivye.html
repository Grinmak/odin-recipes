        <h3 class="description">It's hard to find more popular salad in Russia than this</h3>
        <p>Olivier salad is a traditional Russian potato salad made with 
            finely diced potatoes, carrots, pickles, boiled eggs,
             sweet peas, onions, and bologna or ham, 
             all tossed with a simple dressing of mayonnaise, 
             salt, and pepper. Typically, you’ll find it served at family
              gatherings or on holidays. 
              If you grew up in a Slavic home, you likely have memories of eating 
              a big bowl of it on Christmas.
